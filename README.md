The objective of the course of “Computer Architecture and Computer Architecture Laboratory” is to illustrate the basic aspects of modern electronic computers, as well as to handle and use, during the preposed laboratory activities, the basic concepts for their efficient programming in low-level languages, as machine language and Assembly. To this aim, after a careful coverage of the Boole Algebra (used in laboratory for the Synthesis of sequential and Combinatorial logical Networks), of the binary representation as well as the binary arithmetic, it illustrates in detail, as fundamental elements in the architecture of the information systems, the functional/physic scheme of the CPU, the memory and the I/O subsystem.During the course particular attention is devoted to the development of the Assembly code that, developed by the students as laboratoty activity, in addition to clarify them the effective principle of processor working, explains in detail the task, the interconnection and the interaction among the different basic units of a computer.

Knowledge and comprehension capability: the didactc acitivities carried out during the course aim to provide the student, hypothesized to be endowed with a poor or nonexistent informatic qualification, a good knowledge of both characteristic aspects of binary systems as the functional principles they are based on.
Capability to apply knowledge and comprehension: the theoretical study and the development of the various theoretical/practical tests effected by the sudent during the course, aim to provide him with a correct vision of the computers, with the aim to evidence both the potentialities and the limits they present in the  solution of real problems.

Autonomy of judgement: the student must be able to write programs in Assembly that allow representing and elaborating effectively in binary real problems of different nature.

Communicative abilities: the student must be able to partecipate actively in working groups in design/implemetation/documentation of Assembly applications. To this aim, the knowledge acquired during the course of the correct technical terminology used in the informatic area.

Comprehension capability: the treated topics binary representation/elaboration, logical networks, processors as well as the logical sequence to pass from the ones to the others, provides the student with both a global vision and that of three different areas. The capability of comprehending to the best the possible advantages/disandvantages, that possible technological proposals can bring to a processor, allows the student the capability to autonomously bring himself up to date from the different sources present in Internet.
